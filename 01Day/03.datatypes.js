/*
JavaScript primarily has six basic data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, and Object. Additionally, ES6 introduced Symbol for unique identifiers, and ES2020 introduced BigInt for large integers. 

number = 2 ^ 53
bigint = for large numbers
string = "assembly of characters"
boolean = true or false
null = stand alone value (type = object)
undefined = kindda place holder for a value which is not defined yet (type = undefined)
symbol = uniquness

ECMAScript standards are crucial as they define the specifications for JavaScript. Key milestones include ES6 in 2015, which introduced major features like arrow functions, let/const, and classes. ES2017 brought in async/await for better asynchronous programming.

null - empty
